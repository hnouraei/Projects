Project Description
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a
clinical syndrome in need of improved phenotypic classification. The
objective was to evaluate whether unbiased clustering analysis using
dense phenotypic data could identify phenotypically distinct HFpEF
categories.
In this project, I focused on developing a high-density phenotypic
classification of clinical cardiovascular syndrome. I modeled unbiased
cluster analysis of dense phenotypic data from multiple domains in
meaningful, clinically relevant categories of patients with HFpEF with
significant differences in underlying etiology/ pathophysiology and
differential risk of adverse outcomes.
The findings of this project will be implemented in developing targeted
therapies and also in designing future clinical trials, thereby improving
the track record of HFpEF clinical trials.
